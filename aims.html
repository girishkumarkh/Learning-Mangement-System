        <h1>Project Aims and Objectives</h1> <br>
        <p class="lead">The aims based on each stage to be delivered in the Final Report will include the following:</p>
 		<p class="lead">To provide detailed research about endoscopes and types of operations it is capable of performing.</p>
		<p class="lead">To list the possible data that could be extracted for the simulators such as angle of the endoscope tube, depth of insertion, number of collisions occurred, degree of rotations, etc. (these are example aspects; specific details will be confirmed during later stages).</p>
 		<p class="lead">To run certain sample cases to analyse the type of data that can be generated. This data could help me to understand, what type of outputs that can be generated while the simulator performs an action. The outputs that are collected are the data which are generated while there is a moment which are detected when operating the simulator. (i.e. inserting the endoscope into a organ, moving the angle or rotation, etc.) all this information will be exported as a form of output.</p> 
 		<p class="lead">Based on the sample cases collected, to identify the process of analysis of values and to identify the dependencies, patterns, frequencies, etc. within the values or between the users.</p>
 		<p class="lead">Based on the patterns collected, to define an algorithm to process the patterns into user based performance results. (example things like, how well the trainee has inserted the endoscope tube without causing a collision  with a tissues or how well has the trainee minimised the shakiness while using the device - all this information will be calculated based on the data of each movement generated from the simulator).</p>
 		<p class="lead">To program the algorithm using a programming language, and to create a basic structure of the LMS.</p>
 		<p class="lead">To analyse the user interface for efficiency and ease of use. Things like UX will be taken into consideration.</p>
 		<p class="lead">To design the front end UI using designing tools. The design would be based on the result centric so that users can understand their progress and performances when they view it.<br>
 		<p class="lead">To merge the data analytics part of the code with the front end of the system.</p>
 		<p class="lead">To run possible cases through the system to evaluate its robustness.</p>
